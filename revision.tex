The class started with a conversation about the last project if they students liked 
it. Costa was the first to answer and said that it was a tough one because you
could change some parameters and everything will change. Dhruv said that in contrast
with the previous projects the GUI was too messy so it was hard to debug. Sean
added that small scale test was the best in order to understand what is going on.
Manyi also commented that you debug with small and then proceed to larder boards.
Vinay's opinion is that the GUI was fine and it gave you the clustering view you 
wanted in order to debug clustering problems. Sagar believes that having some more
ticks to view the changes would be better.

For the wrap up Professor started with the question how many times you have gone
through the notes. By raising hands the majority of the students said once or twice.
In the following question of why Preetam answered that went to see the configurations
for the tournament. Dhruv read the notes for some ideas and cite in a presentation.

The Professor asked about what have you thought this course would be.
